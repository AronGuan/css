One dose of caffeine is generally considered to be 100 mg. In theory, 
a single serving (6 fl oz / 150 ml) of drip coffee or one-half caffeine 
tablet would deliver this dose. In the real world, coffee varies considerably 
in caffeine content per serving, ranging from about 75 mg to 250 mg. 
Generally, dark roast coffee has less caffeine than lighter roasts since 
the roasting process reduces caffeine content of the bean.
